# Blog Boom

This is a Full Stack development project I built using the MERN stack, which consists of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. In this README, I'll walk you through the key components and features of the project.

## Introduction to the MERN Stack

I chose the MERN stack for this project because it's ideal for developing modern web applications. Here's a brief overview of each component:

- *MongoDB*: It's our database, allowing us to store and manage data efficiently.
- *Express*: This web application framework simplifies server-side development.
- *React*: The frontend library we use to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- *Node.js*: Our server runtime for building scalable and high-performance applications.

## Setting Up the Frontend

To get started, I created a new React application. Here are the key steps:

- I installed and configured react-router-dom for client-side routing.
- I utilized axios to make HTTP requests to the backend.
- To enhance the user interface, I used react-icons to incorporate stylish icons.

## Building the Backend

The backend of this project is powered by Express.js and MongoDB. Here's how I set it up:

- I initialized an Express.js server to handle HTTP requests.
- For database modeling and interactions, I integrated mongoose.
- To implement user authentication, I used bcrypt for password hashing and jsonwebtoken for user sessions.
- User sessions are managed with cookie-parser and express-session.
- Environment variables are securely managed using dotenv.

## Creating the Blog App

The core of this project is the Blog App, which allows users to create, edit, and delete their blog posts. Here's how it's done:

- I connected the frontend and backend to ensure seamless communication.
- Blog posts are fetched and displayed from the backend.
- User authentication was added to protect routes and ensure secure access.

## Uploading Images

Incorporating image uploads into the Blog App was an essential feature. Here's how I handled it:

- I integrated multer to manage file uploads.
- Images are stored on the server and served to the frontend when needed.
